Step-by-Step Guide: Building an Age Calculator with Webcalc
Based on your Webcalc platform's features, here's a complete tutorial for creating an age calculator using the drag-and-drop builder:

üöÄ Getting Started
Step 1: Access the Calculator Builder
Sign in to your Webcalc account (use the "Sign In with Replit" button)
Go to your Dashboard
Click "Create New Calculator" button
You'll be redirected to the Builder interface
‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Set Up Calculator Basic Information
In the left sidebar under "Calculator Settings":

Name: Change from "Untitled Calculator" to "Age Calculator"
Description: Add something like:
Calculate your exact age in years, months, and days. 
Perfect for birthdays, age verification, or just curiosity!
Payment Settings:
Leave "Requires Payment" turned OFF for a free calculator
(Or turn ON and set a price if you want to monetize it)
üß© Step 3: Add Input Fields
From the Component Palette on the left, drag these fields onto the Canvas:

Field 1: Birth Date Input
Drag a "Text Input" component to the canvas
Click on the field to select it
In the Properties Panel (right sidebar):
Label: "Birth Date"
Placeholder: "MM/DD/YYYY"
Required: Turn ON
Field ID: Note this (e.g., "field1") - you'll use it in formulas
Field 2: Current Date Input (Optional)
Drag another "Text Input" component
Properties:
Label: "Current Date (leave empty for today)"
Placeholder: "MM/DD/YYYY"
Required: Turn OFF
Field ID: Note this (e.g., "field2")
üìä Step 4: Add Result Display Fields
Add these "Result Display" components for showing different age calculations:

Result 1: Age in Years
Drag a "Result Display" component
Properties:
Label: "Your Age in Years"
Result 2: Age in Months
Drag another "Result Display" component
Properties:
Label: "Your Age in Months"
Result 3: Age in Days
Drag another "Result Display" component
Properties:
Label: "Your Age in Days"
üî¢ Step 5: Create the Age Calculation Formula
In the Formula Editor (left sidebar), enter this JavaScript formula:

// Convert date strings to Date objects
const birthDate = new Date(field1);
const currentDate = field2 ? new Date(field2) : new Date();
// Calculate the difference in milliseconds
const diffInMs = currentDate - birthDate;
// Convert to different units
const ageInDays = Math.floor(diffInMs / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
const ageInMonths = Math.floor(ageInDays / 30.44); // Average days per month
const ageInYears = Math.floor(ageInDays / 365.25); // Account for leap years
// Return the result you want to display (modify based on which result field this is for)
ageInYears
Note: Since Webcalc's current formula system shows one result, you might need to create separate calculators for each unit OR modify the formula to return a combined result like:

const birthDate = new Date(field1);
const currentDate = field2 ? new Date(field2) : new Date();
const diffInMs = currentDate - birthDate;
const ageInDays = Math.floor(diffInMs / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
const ageInYears = Math.floor(ageInDays / 365.25);
const ageInMonths = Math.floor((ageInDays % 365.25) / 30.44);
const remainingDays = ageInDays % Math.floor(30.44);
`${ageInYears} years, ${ageInMonths} months, ${remainingDays} days`
üëÄ Step 6: Test Your Calculator
Click "Preview" button in the top toolbar
Test with sample dates:
Birth Date: "01/15/1990"
Leave Current Date empty (uses today)
Click "Calculate" to see results
Verify the age calculation is accurate
üé® Step 7: Customize and Style (Optional)
Enhanced Features You Can Add:
Dropdown for Date Format:

Add a "Select Dropdown" component
Options: "MM/DD/YYYY", "DD/MM/YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD"
Label: "Date Format"
Checkbox Options:

Add "Checkbox" for "Include leap years in calculation"
Add "Checkbox" for "Show result in different time units"
Additional Number Inputs:

"Number Input" for birth year (instead of full date)
"Number Input" for birth month
"Number Input" for birth day
üíæ Step 8: Save and Publish
Click "Save" to save your calculator
Click "Publish" to make it publicly accessible
Click "Share" to get the shareable URL
Your calculator is now live at: https://your-repl.replit.app/public/[calculator-id]
